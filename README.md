# COSC422 Non-Photorealistic Rendering Assignment
This repository contains my submission for the COSC422 Non-Photorealistic Rendering Assignment. It is a doplhin that is rendered as pencil shading or two-tone shading.

## Extra Features
- Mipmap Textures
- Edge Thickness Variation
- Overlapping Silhoutte Edges
- Texture Blending
